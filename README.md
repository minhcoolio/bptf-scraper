# bptf-scraper
Python program that is designed to scrape the bp.tf website and find opportunities of arbitrage. I implemented this functionality with a Selenium webscraper. It targets the buying and selling listings of bots and compares the pricing data between them.

I implemented this program using an OOP approach by parsing all necesssary info from the listings and categorizing the data into my own data type. This helped me keep organized and efficient code when working with many helper functions.
